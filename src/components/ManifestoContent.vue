          <stylized-list-item>By default, the mainstream is not conducive to awareness. Subvert mainstream thinking via both process and aesthetic.</stylized-list-item>
          <stylized-list-item>No genres. They are not useful.</stylized-list-item>
          <stylized-list-item>Professional quality work can be meaningful, but â€œbuttoned up" is not an aesthetic worth pursuing.</stylized-list-item>
          <stylized-list-item>Improvisation is a core tenant of creativity. The unpredictable and fleeting nature is directly tied to the flow of reality.</stylized-list-item>
          <stylized-list-item>Always be open to experimentation, even if that means experimenting with embracing mainstream thinking.</stylized-list-item>
          <stylized-list-item>The idea of "progress" is irrelevant. Being present and grounded overrides black and white dogmas.</stylized-list-item>
          <stylized-list-item>Don't hesitate to throw away or redo work. Also, don't get stuck in a loop where nothing is ever finished.</stylized-list-item>
          <stylized-list-item>The act of developing and exploring a creative process is more valuable than any creative output.</stylized-list-item>
          <stylized-list-item>Art does not need to be accessible.</stylized-list-item>
          <stylized-list-item>There is nothing to work towards. You are already there and have always been there.</stylized-list-item>
