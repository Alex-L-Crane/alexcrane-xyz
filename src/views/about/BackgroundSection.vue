              Well, yeah...<br><br>

              It's been a long road, and the end still isn’t in sight.

              Chasing something real out here takes time — slow and loud time.

              <br><br>I’ve never been much for turning bolts in someone else’s machine.

              So no, I haven’t walked a straight professional line.

              Most of the work that’s mattered — the stuff with teeth — came from freelance, from favors, from figuring it out on the fly.

          I didn’t know what the word “ideology” meant when I first felt it — but I knew it was everywhere.

          Trying to make sense of the world meant swimming through a mess of beliefs, each one louder than the last. It’s what makes life fascinating. And exhausting.

          I was born in upstate New York, spent my childhood in the mountains of western Massachusetts, then got dropped into rural Arizona at thirteen — desert, border towns, a different rhythm entirely.

          Since then: San Francisco. Tucson. L.A. Vegas. Eugene. Planes. Passports.

          I’ve worked with people from just about every walk of life. That’s been one of the great joys.

          But what they believe? That’s the puzzle.

          I’ve never done well with ready-made worldviews. I’m not wired for doctrine.

          Maybe that’s why I ended up here — chasing meaning the only way I know how: through art, through work, through rhythm.
