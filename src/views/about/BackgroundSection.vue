          Yeah... it's been a long road and the end isn't in sight yet. The quest for realness in this world is slow and intense. I wouldn't say that being a small cog in a large wheel is my style. As a result, I've rarely been strictly focused on one professional discipline. Much of the noteworthy work I’ve done has been on a freelance or informal basis. Here are some highlights:

        At some point when I was relatively young, before I knew what the term even meant, I became painfully aware of the concept of ideology. One of the most complicated aspects of life is navigating through a sea of different ideologies. A multitude of worldviews and agendas is at once what makes the world so interesting, but also so frustrating. I was born in upstate New York and lived in the mountains of Massachusetts until I was 13, when my family moved to a rural part of Arizona near the Mexican border. As an adult, I’ve mostly lived in larger cities – San Francisco, Tucson, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Eugene. I’ve also traveled and worked internationally. One of the great pleasures in my life has been knowing and working with a vast array of different humans. One of the great complexities has been trying to fathom the often perplexing and contradictory belief systems that people hold. This is especially complicated considering that I personally avoid pre-ordained world views. I think this long running curiosity about ideology is why the life of an artist suits me.
